# weather_dashboard
## Description
This project had the objective of learning to work with making calls to an API and displaying the results on the page. The OpenWeather API was used to make a weather dashboard that displays the current weather and five day forecast for a city which is provided by the user as a search query. Through doing this project, I learned how to interpret the data from the OpenWeather API requests and how to manipulate it and place it on the page. The Materialize css library was used for the styling. Learing how to use these elements was also a result of completing this assignment.
